`btabler` is a package which adds wraps the `xtable` package, adding
additional functionality such as merging header columns.

Note that `btabler` does not produce HTML tables. If using `.Rmd`,
`output` should be `pdf_document`.

## Example usage

### Installing the package

The package can be installed from the DCR universe via

``` r
install.packages('btabler', repos = c('https://dcr-unibe-ch.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

### Using the package

Load it as usual:

``` r
library(btabler)
```

Create your tables via whatever means and pass them to the `btable`
function:

``` r
df <- data.frame(name = c("", "Row 1", "Row2"),
                 out_t = c("Total", "t1", "t1"),
                 out_1 = c("Group 1", "g11", "g12"), 
                 out_2 = c("Group 2", "g21", "g22"))
btable(df, nhead = 1, nfoot = 0, caption = "Table1")
```

`btable` returns the latex code for the table you passed, which can be
easily used with sweave to create tables in reports.

As an example for further modifications, column widths can also be
modified using the `aligntot` argument:

``` r
btable(df, nhead = 1, nfoot = 0, 
       caption = "Table1", 
       aligntot = "p{3cm}p{1.5cm}p{1.5cm}p{1.5cm}")
```

See the vignette for further examples of using `btabler`

``` r
vignette("btabler")
```

## Requirements for the header

`btabler` tables are only interpretable by LaTeX when a few packages are
loaded. It is recommended to place the following code in the header of
your `.tex` file or `.Rmd`

    # .tex
    \usepackage{longtable}
    \usepackage{booktabs}
    \usepackage{float}
    \usepackage{array}

    # .Rmd
    header-includes:
      - \usepackage{longtable}
      - \usepackage{booktabs}
      - \usepackage{float}
      - \usepackage{array}

Other things like custom column types can also be added to the header
(see the vignette for an example)

``` r
vignette("btabler")
```

`btabler` provides basic templates in `Rmd` and `Rnw` formats:

``` r
use_btabletemplate("filename", "Rmd")
```
